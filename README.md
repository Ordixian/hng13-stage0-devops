## 📖 Project Description
This is my Stage 0 DevOps project for the HNG13 Internship.  
It involves deploying an **NGINX web server** that serves a custom HTML page over HTTP.  
The deployment was done locally and made publicly accessible using **ngrok**.

---

## 🌐 Deployment Details
**Server URL:** [https://lilian-gambogian-prevalently.ngrok-free.dev](https://lilian-gambogian-prevalently.ngrok-free.dev)  
**Deployed On:** 16th October 2025  
**Platform:** NGINX (via Localhost + ngrok)  
**Server IP:** (N/A — using ngrok public tunnel)

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Installed and configured **NGINX** to serve static content.  
2. Edited `/var/www/html/index.html` to include custom deployment info.  
3. Used **ngrok** to expose port 80 publicly for remote access.  
4. Verified the page is live and accessible externally.
